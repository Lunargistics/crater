This is the suggested template for new Crater Plugins.

Note that a LIP (Lunargistics Improvement Proposals) number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your LIPs, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `LIPs-draft_title_abbrev.md`.

## Simple Summary (2 Sentences)
"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the LIPs.

## Abstract
A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.

## Motivation
The motivation is critical for LIPss that want to change the HERC protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the LIPs solves. LIPs submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

## Specification
The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature and the problems it sovles. The specification should be detailed enough to allow implementation.

## Rationale
The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.

## Test Cases
Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for LIPss that are affecting consensus changes. Other LIPss can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.

## Implementation
The implementations must be completed before any LIPs is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the LIPs is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.
